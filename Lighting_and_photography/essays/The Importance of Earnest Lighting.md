# The Importance of Earnest Lighting 

by Moses Eribo

## Chapter 1: Fundamentals And Three Points

"Then there was light" even from the biblical perspective we can see the importance of illumination and the role it plays as a key component of our work in design. Whether the scene is still or moving, live action, animated, or even digital; understanding how lighting can effect the overall composition of a piece, and understanding how to use lighting to achieve a certain effect, can greatly enhance our work.

Hopefully my opening did not come off as bloated exposition, lighting to a beginner (like myself at the point of writing this) seems overtly simple. If the scene is dark, stick a light in it and fix issues in post. However within my first hour of learning lighting in photography, I found that there was much more to it that that.

My introduction to lighting  in photography showed me the use of three point lighting. Considered as a standard lighting practice I thought it best to try and gain an understanding of itâ€™s dynamics, before diving to deep into different and more creative lighting techniques. Also as a person who has never worried about lighting, more so out of ignorance than necessity,  I feel as though I still have quite a bit to learn.

From the diagram above we see that the three point lighting system is composed of  a key light, a fill light, and a rim/back light.

As the name suggests the key light
